## Validation

Validated on Windows:

- Java sources compile with `javac --release 17`.
- Deterministic tests run on every local build.
- `jpackage --type app-image` produces `StreamflixDesktop.exe` with bundled Java runtime.
- Packaged `--self-test` verifies runtime dependencies, provider registry, version consistency, build-time mpv and updater write access before the public package is stripped of the build-time mpv binary.
- Real movie and series playback paths have been validated through mpv.
- The image cache was observed writing real catalog images under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Streamflix\cache\images`.
- `release.ps1` creates versioned and stable-name EXE, MSI and ZIP assets with SHA-256 files.
- The pinned mpv archive was independently re-downloaded from the exact upstream GitHub release and matched GitHub's published SHA-256.
- A clean public-package first-playback provisioning test with no mpv in PATH/global locations provisioned the runtime into a temporary `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Streamflix\runtime\mpv` in 4 seconds, then left Streamflix alive and responsive.
- Public ZIP inspection confirmed zero `mpv.exe` entries while retaining the four mpv provenance/license notice files.
- A real public portable update from 1.3.6 → 1.3.7 completed end to end in an isolated profile: release detection, ZIP download, published SHA-256 match, staged replacement, relaunch into 1.3.7, no rollback directory left behind and no update error log.

Deterministic gates currently include JSON, provider/TMDb/M3U fixtures, extractors, dependency smoke,
user data, mpv player, playback fallback/server ranking, updater parsing, image disk cache, diagnostics privacy and mpv bootstrap tests.

## Release engineering

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs deterministic builds/tests on Windows and Linux.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` is tag-driven and refuses a tag that does not match `VERSION`.
- Release jobs download the pinned mpv archive for build/self-test, remove the build-time mpv binary from the public package, and publish stable-name and versioned EXE, MSI and ZIP assets with their SHA-256 files.
- The per-user EXE is the recommended download; the MSI is intended for managed/admin deployment; the portable ZIP remains available for advanced use and updater compatibility.
- Public installations provision mpv directly from the pinned upstream GitHub release on the first playback attempt that needs it, after SHA-256 verification; Streamflix does not redistribute `mpv.exe` in its ZIP.
- The application checks GitHub Releases asynchronously; no Streamflix backend is required.
- User settings, favorites and history live outside the application directory and are not replaced by updates.

## Remaining audit items

- Re-run the public updater E2E periodically across future release boundaries; the 1.3.6 → 1.3.7 path has already passed.
- TMDb playback currently has one certified route (VixSrc); independent playback routes would improve resilience.
- Some public provider sites can change HTML, domain or anti-bot behavior without notice.
- `MainFrame` and `EmbeddedPlayerWindow` remain large classes and should be decomposed incrementally, not rewritten wholesale.
- More silent provider/extractor fallback catches should be converted to structured diagnostics where doing so does not create noisy logs.
- On-demand mpv provisioning at the first playback attempt that needs it depends on availability of the pinned upstream GitHub asset; the already provisioned runtime remains local and reusable if GitHub is later unavailable.
